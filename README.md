## Business Understanding
Seldovatt Realtors wants to understand the factors that influence house prices in the county and develop a model that can accurately predict house prices based on those factors.

## Data Understanding
I utilized the "kc_house_data.csv" dataset, which provides detailed information on various features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more. Through a rigorous data understanding process, I gained insights into the dataset's structure, data type, and missing values.

## Modeling
I used multiple linear regression to model the house sales dataset. The preprocessing involved handling missing values and creating dummy variables. Relevant predictors such as  square footage, condition, and floors were selected. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R2. The coefficients were analyzed to understand the relationships between predictors and house prices. Regression diagnostics ensured the model's reliability and adherence to assumptions.

## Regression results
We reject the Null hypothesis that the price is affected by other factors.

## Conclusion
Utilize the regression model to guide pricing strategies, considering factors like square footage, bedrooms, and location.
Focus on renovations that have a significant impact on house prices, such as increasing square footage or improving the condition of the house.
